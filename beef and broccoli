This is a modern take on the combination of steak, the meatiest of meats, and broccoli, the veggiest of vegetables.

Prepare a chili oil made with ghee instead of oil. Put dried kashmiri chili flakes in a heat safe container. Other chilies are optional if you want it to be offensively spicy. Heat up ghee, toss in a sample of chili flakes to test heat, and if they bubble pour it all into the container.

Prepare the steak by salting and drying it for internal flavour and a good crust. There is no good reason to put any other spice on the steak now rather than later. Then, lightly coat a pan with ghee. The goal here is to get that buttery flavour without basting the entire steak in butter at the end, as some recipes do. Put the steak in ripping hot. Don't be afraid to turn down the temperature or turn the steak a few times to get the ideal crust; that this could harm the steak is a conventional opinion but not a scientific one. You can leave it to rest in the pan with the heat off to help the inside cook. When it's done, season with pepper and garlic powder.

Brocolli should be roasted until a desirable texture is reached and there is a small amount of char. Salt the brocolli as individual heads and roast them dry in an oven or anywhere with dry heat. The goal is to avoid residual brocolli juices spoiling the rest of the meal, that's why we don't boil or steam it. 

When this is done, drizzle the chili oil and a bit of honey over the brocolli. The idea is the honey helps releive the spice and the florets will absorb and hold the oil, making the broccoli moist.
